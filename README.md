# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets Using Machine Learning

This project shows us how to use machine learning models to create a natural language processing model, which can then be expanded to deep learning models. It's a beginner's project. This project teaches us how to pre-process and feature engineer data in order to prepare it for modeling. We can enhance it by adding new models because just two machine learning models have been created and hyperparameter tweaked similarly. The data was obtained from the kaggle competition Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets.
