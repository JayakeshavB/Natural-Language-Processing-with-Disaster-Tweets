# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets Using Machine Learning

This project shows us how to use machine learning models to create a natural language processing model, which can then be expanded to deep learning models. It's a beginner's project. In this project, we will learn how to preprocess and feature engineer data in order to prepare it for modeling. We can enhance it by adding new models because just two machine learning models have been created and hyperparameters tweaked similarly. The data was obtained from the Kaggle competition Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets.

A new Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets_deep_learining_models.ipynb file has been added to the repository that was implemented with a deep learning model called bidirectional LSTM (the model was created for reference to understand how to solve this problem using deep learning. It can be further enhanced by altering the parameters of the model and by using a different set of models to achieve the desired results).
